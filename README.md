`Honeycombüêù` provides a way to search for all your bookmarks instead of sifting through folder after folder. The app's mission is to change the way we locate a saved bookmark.

Requires [Honeycombüêù front end](https://github.com/markghaida/voronoi-frontend-) and [Honeycombüêù back end](https://github.com/markghaida/voronoi-back).

## Technologies Used

`Honeycombüêù` is built with a `React` front end, a `Ruby on Rails` and `PostgreSQL` back end, `Paper.js` for the honeycomb-like design, and `Kumarai Gem` to srape all websites for necessary metadata. All styling was done with custom CSS. The live link for `Honeycombüêù` is deployed on [Netlify](https://honeycomb-app.netlify.app/) with [Heroku](https://honeycomb-app.herokuapp.com/bookmarks) for the back end.

## Features

The name ***Honeycomb*** comes from the design of how the bookmarks are displayed.  The design is actually a voronoi diagram which creates a honeycomb effect.  Users are both able to create bookmarks and search for a saved bookmark. Once a user comes across a website they would like to save, they simply have to copy the url and paste it into the search bar.  It is now saved.  Simply search for the site by typing the title of the bookmarked site.

### Create a Bookmark

Users are able to save a bookmark.  Once you navigate to a website that you are interested in saving for later; copy the url address, paste it in the search bar, and then wait a couple seconds.  That's it! It's bookmarked.

### Search For a Bookmark

Once a bookmark is saved, simply begin searching for the website's name.  Honeycomb scrapes the bookmark's h1 title, body text, and main image.

### Fulfilling Requests

Users are able to view all the current pending requests and filter them by distance away. If they have all the items requested, they may accept the request. Once accepted a chat will be assigned to the recipient and the donor.

Once accepted, the status for the request will now show as accepted for both the recipient and donor.

Within each chat, users are able to see the items requested, as well as a map showing the distance between the two users. The map uses [GoogleMap](https://developers.google.com/maps)'s API and pinpoints both users' geolocations.

The recipient and donor are able to chat in real-time due to WebSocket integration. They may also send emojis.

Once the exchange has been made, either user can mark the request as fulfilled. Doing so will be reflected for both the recipient and donor. The status of the request on their profile pages will be updated to fulfilled.

### Accessibility

Honeycombüêù was created with all custom CSS and the use of media queries, making the app is mobile friendly. The sizing of all elements adjust depending on the window size.
